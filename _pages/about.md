<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently enrolled in the School of Data Science and Engineering at East China Normal University, where I am advised by [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) at PLANING lab.
My research interests include data mining, especially graph mining. The research work I have been involved in encompasses heterogeneous graph mining and weakly supervised learning on graphs.
Currently I am exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
