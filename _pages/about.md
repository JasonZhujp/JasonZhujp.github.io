<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year PhD Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of [Prof. Weining Qian](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=KqqoR6gAAAAJ) and [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the PLANING (graPh mining and LANguage processING) lab.

My research interests include:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: applications in graph representation learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), financial technology (Fintech);
- **Graph Neural Networks**: graph prompt tuning, graph active learning, graph self-supervised learning;
- **Large Language Models**: applications in graph RAG, toxicity detection.

★★★ Feel free to reach out to me for academic discussions and collaborations!
