<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first year PhD Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of Prof. Weining Qian and [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the PLANING (graPh mining and LANguage processING) lab.

My research interests include:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: applications in graph representation learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG);
- **Graph Neural Networks**: graph prompt tuning, graph active learning, graph self-supervised learning;
- **Large Language Models**: applications in graph RAG, toxicity detection.
<!-- My research interests include data mining, especially graph mining. The research work I have been involved in encompasses heterogeneous graph mining and weakly supervised learning on graphs. -->
<!-- Currently I am exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). -->
